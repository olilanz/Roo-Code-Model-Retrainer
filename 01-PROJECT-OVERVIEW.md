# Project Overview

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to build a modular system for testing, fine-tuning, and training machine learning models. This system will allow users to:
- **Test and evaluate models** based on a set of pre-defined test cases.
- **Fine-tune existing models** for specific tasks or improve performance on specific benchmarks.
- **Train models from scratch** or with custom datasets, using both pre-trained weights and LoRa integration.
- Provide tooling and infrastructure that allows users to replicate the training process, run tests, and continue model improvement, fostering a community-driven ecosystem.

The projectâ€™s ultimate aim is to help improve interaction protocols between models and other tooling (e.g., Roo Code), ensuring they can execute tasks efficiently while adhering to defined protocols. By providing both trained models and training tools, the project will support the community in producing new models as they become available with advanced capabilities.

## High-level Scope and Goals

The scope of this project includes:
- **Model Testing and Evaluation**: Create a test suite for consistent, reproducible results.
- **Model Fine-tuning**: Train existing models for better adherence to specific use cases or interaction protocols (e.g., Roo Code).
- **Training from Scratch**: Enable training of models from scratch or with partial re-training.
- **Tooling for Model Creation**: Provide tools to enable others to train new models or adapt existing ones for specific tasks.

The key goals are:
- **Efficiency**: Minimize token consumption and reduce latency in testing and training.
- **Flexibility**: Allow users to train models, fine-tune them, and apply them to a wide variety of use cases.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure all tests and training iterations are reproducible for consistent model evaluations.
- **Community Collaboration**: Share tools and trained models to allow other users to build upon existing work.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Modular Design**: The system will be composed of independent components (test generator, test runner, evaluator, training driver, etc.), allowing for flexible customization and extension.
- **Model Testing Suite**: Reproducible testing for consistent evaluation, including feedback mechanisms for model training improvements.
- **Fine-tuning and LoRa Integration**: Ability to fine-tune models with LoRa for lightweight, efficient modifications to model behavior.
- **Gradio Interface**: A user-friendly Gradio interface to manage model testing, training, and evaluation.
- **Training Flexibility**: Ability to resume training, manage checkpoints, and select between LoRa-based or full model training.
- **Open Tooling**: Tooling provided to help others create new models, enabling fast adaptation to new breakthroughs in AI capabilities.

## Target Audience

- **Machine Learning Engineers**: Those looking to fine-tune models for specific tasks or optimize models for specific environments (e.g., resource-constrained hardware).
- **AI Researchers**: Researchers interested in testing new ideas, training models, and exploring different training configurations.
- **AI Enthusiasts and Hobbyists**: Users who want an easy-to-use interface to experiment with model training and fine-tuning.
- **Developers of Custom Tools**: Those integrating models into larger systems, especially those looking to define and enforce communication protocols between models and other tooling (e.g., Roo Code).
