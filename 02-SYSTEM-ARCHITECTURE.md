# System Architecture

## Overview

The architecture of this system is designed to be modular, scalable, and efficient. At the core, it integrates various components that facilitate model testing, fine-tuning, training, and evaluation. Each component operates independently but can interact seamlessly to support the end-to-end workflow. The system is built around an easily extensible framework that allows for quick adaptations and integration of new models or tools.

The architecture follows a client-server model, where components interact via APIs or direct function calls. While the training and testing logic is handled locally on GPUs, the Gradio interface provides a web-based front-end for interacting with the system, making it easy for users to manage models, run tests, and monitor training.

## Component Descriptions
- User Interface (Gradio):
  - Provides a web-based interface where users can choose the model to test or train, manage models, and initiate processes like testing or training.
  - Handles user inputs and provides outputs in an accessible format (e.g., test results, training curves).
- Model Selection & Management:
  - Allows users to load and manage models, whether pre-trained or in need of fine-tuning.
  - Supports integration with external sources, like Ollama, to download models on demand.
- Model Testing:
  - Handles testing of models based on a defined set of pre-generated test cases.
  - Ensures that all tests are reproducible, giving consistent and comparable results.
- Model Fine-tuning:
  - Fine-tunes models on specific tasks or protocols (e.g., Roo Code interaction).
  - Supports LoRa integration for lightweight adjustments to models without retraining the entire model.
- Training Process:
  - Manages the process of training models from scratch or resuming from previous checkpoints.
  - Supports multi-GPU configurations for faster training times.
- Checkpointing:
  - Saves the model state at intervals during training, allowing for training to be paused and resumed without losing progress.
- LoRa Integration:
  - Enables users to make small, targeted adjustments to a model by applying LoRa fine-tuning, resulting in smaller model size and more efficient training.
- Model Evaluation:
  - Performs evaluation on models, checking them against predefined tests and benchmarks.
  - Provides feedback for improvements based on evaluation results.
- Test Suite & Evaluation Results:
  - A collection of test cases to evaluate the model’s performance.
  - Outputs evaluation results such as performance metrics, error rates, and feedback.
- Response Evaluator:
  - Responsible for analyzing the model’s responses, ensuring they adhere to defined protocols and expectations.
  - Helps provide feedback during both testing and training phases, guiding improvements.
- Reinforcement Feedback:
  - Incorporates feedback from the response evaluator to guide the fine-tuning or retraining process.
  - Allows iterative improvement based on test performance and user-defined goals.
- Performance Metrics:
  - Provides performance analysis and key metrics such as accuracy, efficiency, and response quality.
  - Assists in identifying areas for further optimization during the training process.

## Interaction Flow
- **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the system via the Gradio interface, selecting a model to test or train.
- **Model Testing or Training:** Depending on the user’s choice, the system either runs tests on the selected model or starts the training process.
- **Evaluation and Feedback:** The system evaluates the model’s performance based on test cases or benchmarks, providing feedback for future iterations.
- **Fine-tuning:** If needed, fine-tuning (including LoRa integration) is applied to the model, improving performance on specific tasks.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** The feedback from evaluations is used to refine the training or fine-tuning process, ensuring the model adheres to the desired behavior.
- **Checkpointing:** Throughout training, checkpoints are created, allowing the process to be paused and resumed at a later time.
- **Model Deployment:** Once training is complete, the final model is ready for deployment or publication, either as a fully trained model or a LoRa-modified model.
